# v2-frame-inversion
Frame inversion mod for the v2

This is an accessiblity mod for the voron v2 to enable easier access to the electronics for people that may have trouble flipping the machine over to get at the electronics bay.

This is a work in progress.

# Description

Wiring Plan:
A/B stepper wires will run through Z chain
X/Y endstops wires will run through Z and Y chains (how can we remove the y chain?)

Wires for Z and Y chains will come out of notch in rear of top deck plate (same size/location as standard v2, just in top panel) (Will this hole cause significant heat loss?)

Bed wiring will run out the back of the skirt and down the rear of the printer. The bottom deck panel will have the same circular hole as the standard v2 for wire entry into the chamber. Wire is stationary, so any wire can be used

Toolhead wires will be an umbilical through the cutout in the top deck panel
